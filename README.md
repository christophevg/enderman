# Enderman

> a (mostly) laser cut version of the Enderman

My son, like many sons loves Minecraft. He especially likes the [Enderman](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enderman). When he wanted to use the character as a base for a school project, but couldn't find a model to start from, we started brainstorming.

It didn't take long before he came up with the idea to start from six simple boxes - for which you can find [great generators online](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de) - and combine those into an Enderman figure.

This repository contains all files that led up to the final result. This includes the original boxes as they were generated, the assembled all-in-one ready to cut layouts and a small 3D printable pin to connect the arms to the body. Everything is available in 3mm and 4mm thickness.

A laser-cut solution to attach the head to the body is included. To attach the arms to the body, a 6mm wooden plug will do the trick. While this works, I like to use a 3D printed pin that keeps both parts nice and tightly together:
